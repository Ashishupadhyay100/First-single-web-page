# first-single-web-page
It is just a single web page, made first time using HTML and CSS.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines the structure and contents of a web page – where things go, how they are laid out, and what’s on the page

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the styling/presentation of a web page and the elements on it

You can’t really have one without the other – the two work together to make up the final web page, its design, and the content that’s on it.

Note; when we say “a web page,” what we mean is a single HTML document – a single page that’s part of your website. Whereas, “a website” is the complete thing – your whole site with all its individual web pages.
These kinds of single web pages websites can be used for showing advertisement.
